For this challenge you need to create a simple SUM statement that will sum all the ages.

### people table schema
- id
- name
- age
### select table schema
- age_sum (sum of ages)
>NOTE: Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing.

>NOTE2: You need to use ALIAS for creating age_sum

```sql
-- Create your SELECT statement here

SELECT SUM(age) as age_sum FROM people
```
